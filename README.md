Nexus was being a little bitch and took down my guide so here is my re-upload.

This guide is intended for MO2 users only, use other modmanagers at your own "risk".

Its made for Nolvus v5 but should work with other Wabbajack modlists too, you might need to make some adjustments tho.

If you are on Nolvus v6, I cant guarantee this guide will work as intended, just give it a shot if you want.

There are two versions, one for those who know their way around MO2 and for those who dont, pick the one you need.
